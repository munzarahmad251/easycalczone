  <h1>Understanding Interest Rates on Loans: What You Need to Know</h1>

  <p>Interest rates are one of the most important factors affecting the total cost of a loan. Whether you’re taking a personal loan, home loan, or car loan, understanding how interest rates work can help you save money and avoid surprises. This article explains the types of interest rates, how they impact your repayments, and tips to get the best deal.</p>

  <h2>What Are Interest Rates?</h2>
  <p>An interest rate is the percentage a lender charges you on the loan amount for borrowing money. It is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). The interest is how banks and financial institutions earn profit and covers the risk of lending.</p>

  <h2>Types of Interest Rates</h2>

  <h3>1. Fixed Interest Rate</h3>
  <p>A fixed interest rate stays the same throughout the loan tenure. Your monthly EMI remains constant, making it easier to budget. However, fixed rates might be slightly higher than variable rates initially.</p>

  <h3>2. Floating (Variable) Interest Rate</h3>
  <p>A floating rate can change over time, usually in line with market benchmarks like the RBI’s repo rate or LIBOR. Your EMI may increase or decrease depending on these changes, which means less predictability but sometimes lower rates.</p>

  <h2>How Interest Rates Affect Your Loan Cost</h2>
  <p>The higher the interest rate, the more you pay over the loan’s life. Even a small difference in the rate can add thousands to your total interest payable.</p>

  <h2>Tips to Negotiate Better Interest Rates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a good credit score.</li>
    <li>Shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders.</li>
    <li>Negotiate with your bank based on your creditworthiness.</li>
    <li>Consider shorter tenures for lower interest overall.</li>
    <li>Look out for special promotions or discounts.</li>
  </ul>
